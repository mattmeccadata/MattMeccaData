# Bio

## Education
Matt attended Temple University from 2016-2020, where he graduated atop of one the most prestigious Actuarial Science programs in the world.
At Temple, Matt ardently fought for the North Philadelphia community in which he lived and which he learned to love.
By listening to his neighbors and learning from them, Matt's eyes were opened to the world of service.
He could no longer imagine a career in the insurance industry, and he insisted on working for the common good.

## Service experience
On the way, Matt has served a number of organizations working hard for their communities:
- From 2017-2020 he served his college campus through InterVarsity
- In 2017, he served the youth group of his local church in Scranton, Pennsylvania
- In 2018, he served the Christian Legal Clinics of Philadelphia
- In 2019, he served Temple University's Disability Resources and Services
- Also in 2019, he served the School District of Philadelphia
- In 2020, he served Northern Arizona University's Center for Science Teaching and Learning

## On a personal note...
Matt's personal passions include cooking, golf, professional sports, and travel.
He learned to cook by following along with the Mennonite Central Committee's 'Around the Table' cookbook.
His favorite recipe to cook is eggplant parm, but his favorite cuisine is North African.
He started playing golf at a young age with his father and continues the passion today.
He is a lifelong fan of the Phoenix Suns, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Colorado Avalanche, and New York Yankees (and he realizes how random that selection is).
Now located in Los Angeles, Matt has seen much of the continental U.S. but dreams of seeing Europe, Australia, and Alaska.
His dream is to open a winery in his ancestral homeland of Abruzzo, Italy.
