# Bio

## Education
- I attended Temple University from 2016-2020, where I graduated atop of one the most prestigious Actuarial Science programs in the world
- At Temple, I began to advocate for North Philadelphians
- I learned A LOT from my neighbors there
- These lessons pulled me away from a career in insurance, and towards one in community advocacy

## On a personal note...
My personal passions include cooking, golf, and travel
- I learned to cook by following along with the Mennonite Central Committee's 'Around the Table' cookbook
- My favorite recipe to cook is eggplant parm, but my favorite *cuisine* is North African
- I started playing golf at a young age with my father and still play today
- I'm now located in Los Angeles, but on my way here from PA I've seen much of the continental U.S.
- I hope to see Europe, Australia, and New Zealand next
- My dream is to open a winery in my ancestral homeland of Abruzzo, Italy
